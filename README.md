# Book Search

Quick and simple app to search Google Books. Made using Angular 4.

There's an auth guard, but no actual authentication is required here -- just insert any valid string in the login screen.

TBD if I ever get back to this:
* Unit Tests
* Responsive CSS (Currently optimized for 1024p)
* Filtering
* Infinite Scroll + Lazy load
